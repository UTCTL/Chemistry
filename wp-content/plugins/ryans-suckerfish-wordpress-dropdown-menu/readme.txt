== Description ==

Adds a Son of Suckerfish dropdown menu to your WordPress blog. Visit the <a href="http://ryanhellyer.net/2008/01/14/suckerfish-wordpress-plugin/">Suckerfish WordPress Plugin page</a> for support or to request additional functionality.

The plugin produces W3C valid HTML and CSS and only requires Javascript to function for very old browsers such as IE 6. The Javascript is held in an external file which is linked via IE conditional comments, so only the browsers which require it will download the file.

The options page allows you to choose what items (pages, categories, archives etc.) are included in the menu and whether you want your menu to be keyboard accessible or not.

You can style the dropdown by copy and pasting the code from the <a href="http://ryanhellyer.net/dropdowns/">Suckerfish Dropdown generator page</a>.

== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete `ryans-suckerfish-wordpress-dropdown-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add <?php suckerfish(); ?> to you theme wherever you want the menu to appear (usually your header.php file)
4. Copy and paste the CSS from the <a href="http://ryanhellyer.net/dropdowns/">Suckerfish Generator page</a>
5. Visit the Suckerfish page in your WordPress options menu


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a fully customised version? =

Leave a message on my <a href="http://ryanhellyer.net/contact/">Contact Page</a> with your requirements and I will get back to you ASAP with a quote.

= Why can't the plugin do X, Y or Z? =

It probably can, I just haven't supplied instructions on how to do it. If you have any requests, then please leave them on the <a href="http://ryanhellyer.net/2008/01/14/suckerfish-wordpress-plugin/">Suckerfish WordPress Plugin page</a>. I am constantly updating the plugin with new functionality and I'm far more likely to include the functionality you want if I know there is a demand for it already.

= Why should I use this plugin? =

If you are having trouble making your posts easily accessible to your users without them having to rifle endlessly through pages of posts, then this plugin is for you.

If you have been using a dropdown menu which requires Javascript to work, then this plugin will allow more of your visitors to access your site.

If you want to have an easy way to style your dropdown menu. This plugin is 100% compatible with the code generated on the <a href="http://ryanhellyer.net/dropdowns/">Suckerfish Dropdowns Generator page</a>.

= Does it work for WordPress version x.x.x? =

I have only tested this plugin on WordPress 2.3 to 2.3.3, however it should (in theory) work in WordPress 2.0+. Please let me know if you successfully test it on another version of WordPress.

If you are using a newer version of WordPress than the latest version supported then I suggest trying the plugin anyway. It shouldn't (in theory) break anything other than the plugin itself which you can just delete if it doesn't work.
