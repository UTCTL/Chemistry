== Installation ==

= Install =

1. Unzip the `the-events-calendar.zip` file. 
1. Upload the the `the-events-calendar` folder (not just the files in it!) to your `wp-contents/plugins` folder. If you're using FTP, use 'binary' mode.
1. Update your permalinks to ensure that the event specific rewrite rules take effect.

= Activate =

No setup required. Just plug and play!

= Settings = 

There are a growing number of options you can set to make your calendar behave in a specific manner. Simply click The Event Calendar in the settings panel:

* Donation: Remove our plea for your support
* Default View for Events: Select Calendar or Event list as the default view for the events loop
* Default Country: Select the default country for the admin
* Embed Google Maps: Turn on Google Maps and define the height and width of the map.
* Date / Time format is now managed via the default wordpress setting

= Requirements =

PHP 5.1 OR ABOVE

== Documentation ==

The built in template can be overridden by files within your template.

= Default vs. Custom Templates =

The Events Calendar plugin now comes with default templates for the list view,
    grid view and single post view. If you would like to alter them, create a
    new folder called "events" in your template directory and copy over the
    following files from within the plugin folder (the-events-calendar/views/):

* gridview.php
* list.php
* single.php
* events-list-load-widget-display.php

Edit the new files to your hearts content. Please do not edit the one's in the plugin folder as that will cause conflicts when you update the plugin to the latest release.

= Supported Variables and URLs =

This plugin registers the following rewrite rules, which controls which posts are available in the loop.  The number of posts returned defaults to 10, but is configurable by the $count parameter to get_events().

Events/Upcoming 
&cat=<eventcategory>&eventDisplay=upcoming
  
Displays events starting today in ascending date order.
  
Events/Past
&cat=<eventcategory>&eventDisplay=past

Displays events that started before today in descending date order.
  
Events/2010-01-02
&cat=<eventcategory>&eventDisplay=bydate&eventDate=2010-01-02

Displays only events that start on Jan 2, 2010.

= Template Tags =

**the_event_start_date( $id, $showtime, $dateFormat)**
**the_event_end_date( $id, $showtime, $dateFormat)**

Date format in order of precedence:
- An format string arg given to event_start_date() or event_end_date()
- WP options
- The constant set in the plugin class

Time format comes from:
- WP options
- Constant in the plugin class

**the_event_cost( $id )**
**the_event_venue( $id )**
**the_event_address( $id )**
**the_event_city( $id )**
**the_event_state( $id )**
**the_event_province( $id )**
**the_event_zip( $id )**
**the_event_country( $id )**
**the_event_phone( $id )**

These functions will return the metadata associated with the event. The ID is optional.

**event_google_map_link( $id, $extraArgs, $location )**
**get_event_google_map_link( $id, $extraArgs, $location )**

Echos or returns, respectively, an http:// link to google maps for the event's address.  The ID is optional.

**get_jump_to_date_calendar( )**

Returns a string containing a javascript date calendar.

**is_event( $id )**

Returns true or false if the current post is an event.  ID is optional.

**is_featured_event( $id )**

Returns true or false if the current post is a featured event.  ID is optional.

**event_style( $id )**
**get_event_style( $id )**

Echos or returns, respectively, the event class specified in the admin panel.  ID is optional.

**is_new_event_day()**

Called inside of the loop, returns true if the current post's meta_value (EventStartDate) is different than the previous post.   Will always return true for the first event in the loop.

**get_events( $count )**

Call this function in a template to query the events and start the loop.   Do not subsequently call the_post() in your template, as this will start the loop twice and then you're in trouble.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Displaying_Posts_Using_a_Custom_Select_Query#Query_based_on_Custom_Field_and_Category

**events_displaying_past()**

Returns true if the query is set for past events

For those of you who have the Eventbrite plugin turned on:

**event_google_map_embed( $id, $width, $height)**

Returns an embedded google map. Width and height are set through the admin panel unless overridden directly through the function call.

**the_event_tickets( $id, $width, $height)**

Returns an EventBrite.com embedded ticket sales inline (not wordpress) widget 

= Top of the Loop Cron =

On the day of the event (at midnight) the plugin runs a cron which updates the post date to show the even at the top of the loop.

A huge thanks to our first round of translators! They helped us tackle localization and become a multilingual application. If you have any interest in translating, grab the .pot file in the /lang/ folder and then send us a completed copy. I'd like to suggest you start a thread in the forum so people know you are working on it and can collaborate.

Also, welcome some new contributors:

Dan Cameron, who has worked with us to help makes the default template more theme friendly.

Aaron Rhodes, who has begun doing qa for each release. He has been catching bugs left and right and hopefully will make our releases smoother. You'll be seeing him on the forum.

** Swedish: provided by Kaj Johansson
** French: provided by Benjamin Nizet (Enseignons)
** Italian: provided by Maurizio Lattanzio

** Optional format string argument for event_start_date() or event_end_date(). Otherwise, the format set in WP options is used.
