Special thanks to <a href="http://transientmonkey.com/">Greg Yingling (aka malcalevak)</a> who was a massive help with optomising the code for this plugin.

== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1.  Upload the complete `pixopoint-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory OR install it via the WordPress plugin repository browser<br />
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress<br />
3. Either: Add `<?php if ( function_exists( 'pixopoint_menu' ) ) {pixopoint_menu();} ?>` to your theme wherever you want the menu to appear (usually your header.php file).<br />
4.  Visit the "PixoPoint Menu" page in your WordPress settings menu<br />
5.  Control how the menu behaves via the plethora of different options
6.  Click the 'Load editor' button to modify the design via the easy to use editing panel<br />

= Easy installation =

Some themes such as <a href="http://themehybrid.com/">Hybrid</a>, <a href="http://thematic.com/">Thematic</a> and Thesis allow the plugin to appear in the theme by choosing the 'Auto theme support' under 'Settings' in the plugins admin page. This option will also work in many other themes, it's worth trying  at least but we can't guarantee it will work (the theme requires <?php wp_page_menu(); ?> for it work).

If your theme doesn't already support the PixoPoint menu plugin then read on for simple instructions on how to integrate it into other themes ... it isn't very hard

= Premium Support =

= Free support =

We no longer provide free support for menu issues sorry.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't the plugin do X, Y or Z? =
