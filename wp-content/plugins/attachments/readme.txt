Attachments allows you to simply append any number of items from your WordPress Media Library to Posts, Pages, and Custom Post Types

== Description ==

Attachments allows you to simply append any number of items from your WordPress Media Library to Posts, Pages, and Custom Post Types. This plugin *does not* directly interact with your theme, you will need to edit your template files.

There is an [outdated] **screencast available** on the [plugin home page](http://mondaybynoon.com/wordpress-attachments/) that will be upgraded soon.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and extract the files
1. Upload `attachments` to your `~/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Update your templates where applicable (see **Usage**)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Attachments are not showing up in my theme =

You will need to edit your theme files where applicable. Please reference the **Usage** instructions

= Where are uploads saved? =

Attachments uses WordPress' built in Media library for uploads and storage.

= I lost my Attachments after upgrading! =

***DO NOT update any Post/Page/CPT with Attachments***, the data has not been lost. Please [contact me](http://mondaybynoon.com/contact/) to begin a bugfix

== Screenshots ==

1. Attachments meta box as it appears on Posts, Pages, or Custom Post Types
2. Native WordPress browse modal dialog, slightly customized for Attachments. Upload straight from your computer.
3. You can also browse the existing media in your Media Library. The dialog remains open, allowing you to attach multiple assets.
4. Once assets have been attached, you can customize the title, caption, and order

== Roadmap ==

Planned feature additions include:

* Physically attaching Attachments to Posts/Pages/Custom Post Types on a WordPress level
* Modifying UI to provide ability to better bulk-add Attachments

== Usage ==

After installing Attachments, you will need to update your template files in order to pull the data to the front end.

To pull all Attachments for a Post or Page, fire `attachments_get_attachments()`. There is one optional parameter which can force a Post ID if `attachments_get_attachments()` is fired outside The Loop. If used inside The Loop, all Attachments will be pulled for the current Post or Page.

Firing `attachments_get_attachments()` returns an array consisting of all available Attachments. Currently each Attachment has four pieces of data available:

* **title** - The attachment Title
* **caption** - The attachment Caption
* **id** - The WordPress assigned attachment id (for use with other WordPress media functions)
* **location** - The attachment URI
* **mime** - The attachment MIME type (as defined by WordPress)

Here is a basic implementation:

`<?php 
  if( function_exists( 'attachments_get_attachments' ) )
  {
    $attachments = attachments_get_attachments();
    $total_attachments = count( $attachments );
    if( $total_attachments ) : ?>
      <ul>
      <?php for( $i=0; $i<$total_attachments; $i++ ) : ?>
        <li><?php echo $attachments[$i]['title']; ?></li>
        <li><?php echo $attachments[$i]['caption']; ?></li>
        <li><?php echo $attachments[$i]['id']; ?></li>
        <li><?php echo $attachments[$i]['location']; ?></li>
        <li><?php echo $attachments[$i]['mime']; ?></li>
      <?php endfor; ?>
      </ul>
    <?php endif; ?>
<?php } ?>`
